    # This file can be parsed as follows.
    #
    #   parser = ICU::Tournament::Krause.new
    #   tournament = parser.parse_file('tournament.tab')
    #
    # If the file is correctly specified, the return value from the <em>parse_file</em> method is an instance of
    # ICU::Tournament (rather than <em>nil</em>, which indicates an error). In this example the file is valid, so:
    #
    #   tournament.name                   # => "Fantasy Tournament"
    #   tournament.start                  # => "2009-09-09"
    #   tournament.fed                    # => "IRL"
    #   tournament.players.size           # => 9
    #
    # Some values, not explicitly set in the file, are deduced:
    #
    #   tournament.rounds                 # => 3
    #   tournament.finish                 # => "2009-09-11"
    #
    # A player can be retrieved from the tournament via the _players_ array or by sending a valid player number to the _player_ method.
    #
    #   minnie = tournament.player(1)
    #   minnie.name                       # => "Mouse, Minerva"
    #   minnie.points                     # => 1.0
    #   minnie.results.size               # => 2
    #
    #   daffy = tournament.player(2)
    #   daffy.title                       # => "IM"
    #   daffy.rating                      # => 2200
    #   daffy.fide_rating                 # => nil
    #   daffy.fed                         # => "IRL"
    #   daffy.id                          # => nil
    #   daffy.fide_id                     # => 7654321
    #   daffy.dob                         # => "1937-04-17"
    #
    # By default, ratings are interpreted as ICU. If, instead, they should be interpreted as
    # FIDE ratings, add the _fide_ option:
    #
    #   tournament = parser.parse_file('tournament.tab', :fide => true)
    #   daffy = tournament.player(2)
    #   daffy.rating                      # => nil
    #   daffy.fide_rating                 # => 2200
    #
    # ID numbers, on the other hand, are automatically classified as either FIDE or ICU on the basis of size.
    # IDs larger than 100000 are assumed to be FIDE IDs, while smaller numbers are treated as ICU IDs.
    #
    # If the ranking numbers are missing from the file or inconsistent (e.g. player A is ranked above player B
    # but has less points) they are recalculated as a side effect of the parse.
    #
    #   daffy.rank                        # => 1
    #   minnie.rank                       # => 2
    #   mickey.rank                       # => 3
    #
    # Comments in the input file (lines that do not start with a valid data identification number) are available from the parser
    # instance via its _comments_ method (returning a string). Note that these comments are reset evry time the instance is used
    # to parse another file.
    #
    #   parser.comments                   # => "0123456789..."
    #
    # If the file contains errors, then the return value from <em>parse_file</em> is <em>nil</em> and
    # an error message is returned by the <em>error</em> method of the parser object. The method
    # <em>parse_file!</em> is similar except that it raises errors, and the methods <em>parse</em>
    # and <em>parse!</em> are similar except their inputs are strings rather than file names.
    #
    # == Serialization
    #
    # A tournament can be serialized back to Krause format (the reverse of parsing) with the _serialize_ method of the parser.
    #
    #   krause = parser.serialize(tournament)
    #
    # Or alternatively, by the _serialize_ method of the tournament object if the name of the serializer is supplied.
    #
    #   krause = tournament.serialize('Krause')
    #
    # By default, local (ICU) IDs and ratings are used for the serialization, but both methods accept an option that
    # causes FIDE IDs and ratings to be used instead:
    #
    #   krause = parser.serialize(tournament, :fide => true)
    #   krause = tournament.serialize('Krause', :fide => true)
    #
    # By default all available information is output for each player, however, this is customizable. The player number,
    # name, total points and results are always output but any of the remaining data (_gender_, _title_, _rating_ or _fide_rating_,
    # _fed_, _id_ or _fide_id_, _dob_ and _rank_) can be omitted, if desired, by specifying an array of columns to include
    # or exclude. To omitt all the optional data, supply an empty array:
    #
    #   krause = tournament.serialize('Krause', :only => [])
    #
    # To omitt just federation and rating but include all others:
    #
    #   krause = tournament.serialize('Krause', :except => [:fed, :rating])
    #
    # To include only date of birth and title:
    #
    #   krause = tournament.serialize('Krause', :only => [:dob, :title])
    #
    # To output FIDE IDs and ratings use the _fide_ option in conjunctions with the _id_ and _rating_ options:
    #
    #   krause = tournament.serialize('Krause', :only => [:gender, :id, :rating], :fide => true)
    #
    # == Parser Strictness
    #
    # In practice, Krause formatted files encontered in the wild can be produced in a variety of different ways and not always according to
    # FIDE's standard, which itself is rather loose. This Ruby gem deals with that situation by not raising parsing errors when data is encountered
    # where it is clear what is meant, even if it doesn't conform to the standards, such as they are. However, on output (serialisation) a strict
    # interpretation of FIDE's standard is adhered to.
    #
    # For example in input data if a player's gender is given as "F" it's clear this means female, even though the specification calls for a lower
    # case "w" (for woman) in this case. Similarly, for titles where, for example, both "GM" and FIDE's "g" are recognised as meaning Grand Master.
    #
    # When it comes to dates, the specification recommends the YYYY/MM/DD format for birth dates and YY/MM/DD for round dates but quotes an example where
    # the start and finish dates are in the opposite order (DD.MM.YYYY) with a different separator. In practice, the author has encountered Krause files
    # with US style date formatting (MM-DD-YYYY) and other bizarre formats (YY.DD.MM) which suffer from ambiguity when the day is 12 or less.
    # It's not the separator ("/", "=", ".") that causes a problem but the year, month and day order. The solution adopted here is for all serialized
    # dates to be in YYYY-MM-DD format (or YY-MM-DD for round dates which must fit in 8 characters), which is a recognised international standard
    # (ISO 8601). However, for parsing, a much wider variation is permitted and there is some ability to detect and correct ambiguous dates. For example
    # the following dates would all be interpreted as 2011-03-30:
    #
    # * 30th March 2011
    # * 30.03.2011
    # * 03/30/2011
    #
    # Where no additional information is available to resolve an ambiguity, the month is assumed to come in the middle, so 04/03/2011 is interpreted
    # as 2011.03.04 and not 2011.04.03.
    #
    # Some Krause files that the author has encountered in the wild have 3-letter player federation codes that are not federations at all but something
    # completely different (for example the first 3 letters of the player's club). This is a clear violation of the specification and raises a parsing
    # exception. However in practice it's often necessary to deal with such files so the parser has two options to help in these cases. If the _fed_ option
    # is set to "ignore" then all player federation codes will be ignored, even if valid. While when set to "skip" then invalid codes will be ignored but
    # valid ones retained.
    #
    #   tournament = parser.parse_file('tournament.tab', :fed => "ignore")
    #   tournament = parser.parse_file('tournament.tab', :fed => "skip")
    #
    # Similar options are available for parsing SwissPerfect files (see ICU::Tournament::SwissPerfect) which can suffer from the same problem.
    #
    # == Automatic Total Correction
    #
    # Another problem encountered with Krause files in practice is a mismatch between the declared total points for a player and the sum of their points
    # from each round. Normally this just raises a parsing exception. However, there is one set of circumstances when such mismatches can be repaired:
    #
    # * the declared total score is higher than the sum of scores,
    # * the player has at least one bye which isn't a full point bye or at least one round where no result is recorded,
    # * the number of byes or missing results is enough to account for the difference in total score.
    #
    # If all these conditions are met then just enough bye scores are incremented, or new byes created, to make the sum match the total, and the
    # data will parse without raising an exception.
    #
    #   012 Mismatched Totals
    #   042 2011.03.04
    #   001    1      Mouse,Minerva                                                      1.0    2     2 b 0  0000 - =
    #   001    2      Mouse,Mickey                                                       1.5    1     1 w 1
    #
    # In this example both totals are underestimates. However, player 1 has a half-point bye which can be upgraded to a full-point and player 2
    # has no result in round 2 which leaves room for the creation of a new half-point bye. So this data parses without error and serializes to:
    #
    #   012 Mismatched Totals
    #   042 2011-03-04
    #   001    1      Mouse,Minerva                                                      1.0    2     2 b 0  0000 - +
    #   001    2      Mouse,Mickey                                                       1.5    1     1 w 1  0000 - =
    #
    # == Tournament Attributes
    #
    # The following lists Krause data identification numbers, their description and, where available, their corresponding
    # attributes in an ICU::Tournament instance.
    #
    # [001 Player record]           Use _players_ to get all players or _player_ with a player number to get a single instance.
    # [012 Name]                    Get or set with _name_. Free text. A tounament name is mandatory.
    # [013 Teams]                   Create an ICU::Team, add player numbers to it, use _add_team_ to add to tournament, _get_team_/_teams_ to retrive it/them.
    # [022 City]                    Get or set with _city_. Free text.
    # [032 Federation]              Get or set with _fed_. Getter returns either _nil_ or a three letter code. Setter can take various formats (see ICU::Federation).
    # [042 Start date]              Get or set with _start_. Getter returns <em>yyyy-mm-dd</em> format, but setter can use any reasonable date format. Start date is mandadory.
    # [052 End date]                Get or set with _finish_. Returns either <em>yyyy-mm-dd</em> format or _nil_ if not set. Like _start_, can be set with various date formats.
    # [062 Number of players]       Not used. Treated as comment in parsed files. Can be determined from the size of the _players_ array.
    # [072 Number of rated players] Not used. Treated as comment in parsed files. Can be determined by analysing the array returned by _players_.
    # [082 Number of teams]         Not used. Treated as comment in parsed files.
    # [092 Type of tournament]      Get or set with _type_. Free text.
    # [102 Arbiter(s)]              Get or set with -arbiter_. Free text.
    # [112 Deputy(ies)]             Get or set with _deputy_. Free text.
    # [122 Time control]            Get or set with _time_control_. Free text.
    # [132 Round dates]             Get an array of dates using _round_dates_ or one specific round date by calling _round_date_ with a round number.
